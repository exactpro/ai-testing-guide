# INTRODUCTION TO AI TESTING: <br> A Guide to ISTQB® CT-AI Certification

Welcome to the GitHub repository dedicated to the "Introduction to AI Testing: A Guide to ISTQB® CT-AI Certification" book! This repository serves as a companion to the book and includes three directories corresponding to three hands-on exercises given in Chapters 4, 6, and 11 of the book. Each directory contains a Jupyter notebook with a task description as well as a sample code written in Python™  providing a possible implementation that can be used to solve the exercise. In this GitHub repository, you will also find datasets for hands-on exercises and the employee dataset used in Chapter 9 of the book.

# Options to run a Jupyter notebook
The first option is to execute the notebook using a web-based interface, for example, Google Colaboratory platform, a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment. For this you need a free Google Gmail account and the storage for Jupyter notebooks in your Google Drive.<br>
The second option is to run the code locally. For this, you will need to set up a PythonTM integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor, such as PyCharm, Jupyter, Visual Studio Code, etc. The Python version should be either equal to or greater than 3.8.1. If you run the Jupyter notebook locally, you will need to skip the steps that describe the mounting of the Google Drive and the file upload via accessing the Google Drive, and go straight to the step of a dataframe creation by reading the csv file using the pd.read_csv() function.<br>
